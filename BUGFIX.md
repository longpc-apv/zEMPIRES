# zEMPIRES bugfixes of the original engine
Ripped from UPatch-HD mod project website.

- In the original game many of the civilization bonuses and technologies have wrong descriptions - with completely different values in reality than those described in help files/manual/in-game text. Most AOE players never knew that these values are not true. Such bugs and inconsistencies (now fixed) have been plaguing the game since its release, not fixed by any of the official patches.
- Another big problem in the game were the extreme values in civilization bonuses. They created huge imbalances and were very unrealistic. Few of those (Shang villager cost, Phoenician woodcutting, Assyrian/Yamato villager speed, etc.) have been addressed by the Rise of Rome Expansion and the last official patch (1.0c), but many others remained until now (fixed in UPatch HD).
- Save game crashes.
- Distorted in-game colors (color bugs) are fixed.
- Fixes to prevent crash to Desktop and inability to start the game.
- Fixed the problem with wrong game fonts, causing incorrectly displayed text in-game.
- Option to select random teams ("?" for team number). Two teams will be formed if everyone selects "?".
- Option to select "Random" in Map Type, so that you don't know which map will be chosen.
- Multiplayer population limit option extended to 400.
- Post-Iron Age option added as starting age in both Single and Multiplayer.
- New Path Finding option "Very High" added, set by default.
- New Idle Military Units hotkey (in addition to the Idle Villager key) - press "," (comma) key to cycle through your idle military units (all units that have an attack and are not currently moving or in combat, this includes war ships).
- New hotkeys to select and go to (previously these were missing): Granary (Ctrl + G), Storage Pit (Ctrl + S), Market (Ctrl + M), Government Center (Ctrl + C), Wonder (Ctrl + O).
- The number of possible unit groups is doubled - numpad keys 0-9 (those on the right) can now be used to create and select unit groups, in addition to the main 0-9 keys.
- New hotkeys to open the Diplomacy menu dialog ("F9"), Multiplayer Chat dialog ("F8" - only in Multiplayer) and Scenario Editor Menu ("F10").
- The game now remembers the last state (shown or hidden) of scores (F4) and timer (F11). For example if you enable scores and then exit the game, next time you play, the scores will be enabled automatically on game start.
- The game now saves screenshots (CTRL+F12) in a new folder /screenshots.
- All ai related files (.ai./.per/.cty) now reside in the new dedicated /ai folder.
- New Starting Resource option added - "Low": 0 Food, 200 Wood, 0 Stone, 0 Gold. Appropriate for Nomad start.
- "High" starting resource option changed 500 Gold, 500 Stone (previously 0 Gold, 750 Stone; Food and Wood unchanged).
- Some additional checks added to the game to ensure everything works correctly; this will also prevent some types of cheats.
- Multiplayer games can better detect version mismatch (this will prevent some possible out of sync errors).
- Prey animals and Berry Bushes are now visible on the mini map in light green color.
- Improved red and orange player colors in the game (including on mini map) - now more distinguishable.
- Mini map colors are improved: player colors are more distinguishable from terrain and other player colors.
- Over half of the computer player build plans (ai) were bugged and are now fixed. Many of these bugs were critical and prevented proper computer player development.
- Computer players no longer change their diplomacy on accidental hits by allies (catapults, elephants, etc).
- Computer players no longer automatically ally with other computer players when they are set to no team ("-").
- Added bonus computer player resources for "Hard" difficulty (+500). Makes computer players a little closer to human development speed and is the recommended difficulty.
- Bonus computer player resources for "Hardest" difficulty to 1500 (previously 2000).
- Fixed technology tree bugs when starting in later ages (for example Minoan Composite bowmen no longer lose their range bonus).
- Ballista/Helepolis no longer receive their Alchemy bonus twice (so it's now +1, not +2).
- All chariots have double attack vs. Priest.
- Dock ship build times and research times fixed (they were quite messed up in the original game).
- War Elephant: fixed missing attack bonus vs. buildings.
- Fixed the extremely large trample damage area of War/Armored Elephant and Scythe Chariot. Their damage area is now reduced to medium-large.
Comment: Previously enemy units were taking damage from 2 tiles away or on the other side of a wall.
- Siegecraft: Bonus attack of villagers against walls and towers is now reduced.
Comment: Previously they were stronger vs walls/towers than fully upgraded Centurions.
- Fishermen gathering rate fixed (was much faster than any other gathering).
- Food in fish is proportional to size (Shore fish has less food, Whales have more).
- Fixed a lot of graphic and sound bugs in the game, including missing/incorrect sounds, misaligned graphics, selection radiuses, hitpoint bars, etc.
- Improved the distribution of randomly generated terrain objects.
- Number of maximum recommended players in map size name – example: "Large (4 Players)"
- Improved in-game text messages/descriptions and the position of some interface elements.
- Full game version is now also displayed on main menu (at the bottom).
- Hundreds of other small bug fixes and improvements.
