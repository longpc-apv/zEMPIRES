# Cheat codes
Press Enter during gameplay and enter the code below. Then press Enter again to complete. The codes are not case sensitive. One the cheat code is initiated, the unit spawns at the Town Center last built. If the town center is researching a new age, the cheat unit cannot be spawned. Any code that affects existing units cannot pass on to enemy units converted by the player. To maximize combat potential, make sure to type the code before researching specific technologies that benefit that unit.

**Units**
- BIG BERTHA: Transforms Stone Throwers, Catapults and Heavy Catapults into Big Berthas, which have more hit points and most importantly, greater range and much larger area of effect.
